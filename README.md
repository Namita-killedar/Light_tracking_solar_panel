# Light_tracking_solar_panel
A light-tracking solar panel automatically adjusts its position to follow the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy capture. Using sensors and a motor-driven mechanism, it continually aligns the panel with sunlight, improving efficiency compared to fixed panels and ensuring optimal power generation.
